# 👋 Hey, I'm Samuel Cabral!

🔥 Passionate about development, I live to create projects that make a difference, with interfaces that are a feast for the eyes and user experiences that are memorable.

## 🚀 My Journey

- 🎓 Started as a full-stack intern, getting hands-on with various projects and helping to automate and make processes more efficient in different areas.

- 💼 Progressed in my career working as a full-stack and front-end developer at companies that are benchmarks in their markets, like **G4Flex** and **Ambar**. There, I had the chance to elevate the platforms to a new level, positively impacting the user experience.

- 🌟 At **TheMembers**, I played a key role in building and optimizing platforms that demonstrated significant user growth and satisfaction. I led the migration to modern frameworks, developed impactful features, and optimized performance, resulting in a substantial increase in user engagement.

- 🚀 Currently, I'm part of the **Algorithmus** team, where I lead the development of Readi’s frontend applications. My focus is on creating robust and scalable interfaces using Next.js, TypeScript, and Material-UI, ensuring high-quality user experiences and technical excellence.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Frameworks

I work with an arsenal of technologies, always in search of best practices:

- **React**
