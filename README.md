## 🚀 My Journey

- 🎓 Started as a full-stack intern, getting hands-on with various projects and helping to automate and make processes more efficient in different areas.

- 💼 Progressed in my career working as a full-stack and front-end developer at companies that are benchmarks in their markets, like **G4Flex** and **Ambar**. There, I had the chance to elevate the platforms to a new level, positively impacting the user experience.

- 🌟 Currently, I'm part of the **TheMembers** team, where I'm a key piece in building and optimizing platforms that have shown user growth and satisfaction.

- And many more!
