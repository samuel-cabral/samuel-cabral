 Hi, there!, I'm a full-stack developer in training at [@Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) ðŸš€

### ðŸš€ Seeking and applying knowledge all the time

My learning is based on creating projects and completing challenges from **Rocketseat** bootcamps.

I'm a full-stack developer in training at the **Rocketseat** School Bootcamps ([rocketseat.com.br](http://rocketseat.com.br/)), with approximately 6 months of experience in web and mobile development.

I work on my personal projects with Node.js, React.js and React Native. I have solid knowledge in functional programming, OOP, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

I am interested in Technologies such as Python / Django, Ruby / on Rails, in application scalability, infrastructure, best development practices, TDD and BDD.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals for 2020

- Conclude the Rocketseat bootcamps
- Turn into hard skilled full-stack web and mobile developer
- Positively influence the lives of people with my skills
