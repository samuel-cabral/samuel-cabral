👋 Hi, there!, I'm a full-stack developer intern 🚀

## 🚀 Seeking and applying knowledge all the time

My learning is based on creating projects and completing challenges from **Rocketseat** bootcamps.

👨‍💻 I'm a trainee Node.js, ReactJS and React Native developer at Pinheiro's Supermarket. I'm looking for Node, React and React Native Junior developer jobs.

🚀 I'm trained in the GoStack bootcamp of rocketseat.com.br, a training focused on the development of web applications with Node.js, ReactJS and mobile cross-platform with React Native.

🔎 I'm interested in Python / Django, Ruby on Rails, infrastructure and application scalability, the best development practices, TDD and DDD and I love studying software engineering, Scrum and design patterns.
